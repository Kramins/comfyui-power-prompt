# Power Prompt

A ComfyUI node for building rich, dynamic prompts from a simple YAML definition. Define named variables with weighted options, conditional filtering, and Jinja2 templating — then let the node assemble your prompt at generation time.

## Features

- **Variables** — define named `select` or `text` variables and reference them in a Jinja2 prompt template
- **Weighted options** — give options a `weight` to control how often they're randomly chosen
- **Count ranges** — pick exactly N, a random range (`1-3`), or any number (`any`) of options
- **`when` / `unless` expressions** — Jinja2 expressions that control which options are available; `when` includes an option when true, `unless` excludes it when true
- **Tags** — attach semantic labels to options; downstream `when`/`unless` expressions can check `style_tags`, `season_tags`, etc.
- **Multi-value options** — a single option entry can expand to multiple values sharing the same weight, tags, and `when`/`unless`
- **UI controls** — `label:` sets a custom display name, `group:` organises variables into named sections, `hidden:` hides a variable from the UI while still resolving it
- **Prompt fragments** — define a `fragments:` mapping of named Jinja2 sub-templates rendered after variables resolve; reference them as `{{ fragment.name }}` in any prompt
- **Partials** — wire one or more **Power Prompt Partial** nodes into include slots to share `variables:` and `fragments:` across compositions

## Installation

1. Clone or copy this folder into `ComfyUI/custom_nodes/comfyui-power-prompt`
2. Install Python dependencies:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Restart ComfyUI — the **Power Prompt** node appears under the `prompt` category

## Local Development

The YAML editor uses a pre-built [CodeMirror 6](https://codemirror.net/) bundle committed at `web/js/vendor/codemirror-bundle.js`. You only need to rebuild it if you update CodeMirror versions or add new editor extensions.

**Prerequisites:** Node.js 18+

```bash
npm install
npm run build-editor
```

This runs `scripts/build-editor-bundle.mjs` via esbuild and overwrites `web/js/vendor/codemirror-bundle.js`. Commit the result alongside any other changes.

## YAML Reference

A Power Prompt YAML has three top-level keys:

```yaml
variables:   # required — named inputs resolved at generation time
  ...

fragments:   # optional — named sub-templates composed from resolved variables
  ...

prompt: |    # required — Jinja2 template rendered after all variables resolve
  ...
```

### Variables

Each entry under `variables:` becomes a UI control and a template variable.

#### Variable fields

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `type` | `select` \| `text` | — | **Required.** `select` picks from a list; `text` is a free-text input. Aliases: `choice` (= select, count 1), `multiselect` (= select, count any) |
| `count` | int \| range \| `any` | `1` | How many options to pick. `1` = single dropdown; `0-3` = random range; `any` = user checks all they want |
| `options` | list | — | Required for `select`. The pool of values to choose from |
| `label` | string | key name | Custom display name shown in the UI panel. Underscores in the key name are replaced with spaces when no label is set |
| `group` | string | — | Groups this variable under a named section header in the UI. All variables sharing the same string are rendered together, before ungrouped variables |
| `hidden` | bool | `false` | When `true`, the variable is not shown in the UI. It is still resolved randomly and available in the prompt and `when`/`unless` expressions |

#### `type: select`

Picks one or more values from the `options` list:

```yaml
variables:
  season:
    type: select
    count: 1          # exactly one — renders as a dropdown
    options:
      - spring
      - summer
      - autumn
      - winter

  accessories:
    type: select
    count: 0-2        # zero to two — renders as a chip group
    options:
      - scarf
      - sunglasses
      - umbrella

  style:
    type: multiselect # alias: count is implicitly "any" — user checks what they want
    options:
      - anime
      - watercolor
      - oil painting
```

#### `type: text`

A free-text input field. The value is whatever the user types:

```yaml
variables:
  notes:
    type: text
    label: "Extra notes"   # shown in the UI as "Extra notes" instead of "notes"
```

#### `label`, `group`, and `hidden`

```yaml
variables:
  internal_season:
    type: select
    hidden: true           # resolved randomly but not shown in the UI panel
    options: [spring, summer, autumn, winter]

  outfit:
    type: select
    label: "Outfit Style"  # displayed as "Outfit Style" instead of "outfit"
    group: "Character"     # appears under a "Character" section header in the UI
    options:
      - casual
      - formal
      - fantasy

  setting:
    type: select
    group: "Character"     # shares the "Character" group with outfit above
    options:
      - city street
      - forest path
      - rooftop
```

---

### Options

Each entry in an `options:` list is either a plain string (shorthand) or a mapping with any of the following fields:

| Field | Type | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| `value` | string \| list | — | The option text. A list expands to multiple independent entries sharing the same weight, `when`, and tags |
| `weight` | float | `1.0` | Relative selection probability. Higher = chosen more often |
| `when` | Jinja2 expression | (always included) | Option is added to the random pool only when this evaluates to `true` |
| `unless` | Jinja2 expression | (never excluded) | Option is removed from the random pool when this evaluates to `true` |
| `tags` | string \| list | `[]` | Semantic labels attached to this value, available as `{varname}_tags` in downstream `when`/`unless` expressions |

```yaml
options:
  - simple string option               # shorthand — weight 1, no conditions

  - value: weighted option
    weight: 3                          # 3× more likely than weight-1 options

  - value: conditional option
    when: "season == 'winter'"         # only available when season is winter

  - value: excluded option
    unless: "'rainy' in weather_tags"  # excluded when the weather has a rainy tag

  - value:                             # multi-value: share weight, when, tags
      - option variant a
      - option variant b
    weight: 2
    tags: [shared_tag]
```

---

### `when` and `unless` expressions

Expressions are evaluated using the **Jinja2 sandbox** — attribute access on unsafe objects is blocked. Variables resolved above the current one in the YAML are available by name.

```yaml
when: "season == 'winter'"
when: "'cold' in season_tags"
when: "'student' in character_tags and 'cold' not in season_tags"
when: "time_of_day in ('dusk', 'night')"
when: "len(accessories) > 0"

unless: "season == 'summer'"
unless: "'rainy' in weather_tags"
```

**Available names in expressions:**

| Name | Value |
|---|---|
| `<varname>` | Resolved string (single-pick) or list (multi-pick) |
| `<varname>_tags` | List of tags from the resolved value(s), deduplicated in encounter order |

**Available functions:** `len`, `any`, `all`, `min`, `max`, `str`, `int`, `float`, `bool`, `abs`, `round`

**Jinja2 notes:**
- Use lists `[x, y]` instead of set literals `{x, y}` — sets are not supported
- Generator expressions (`any(x for x in y)`) are not supported — use `in` membership checks instead
- Both `when` and `unless` can appear on the same option — the option is included only if `when` is true **and** `unless` is false
- Variables must be declared **above** any variable whose `when`/`unless` references them

---

### Prompt fragments

Define named Jinja2 sub-templates that compose from resolved variables. Reference them in the prompt (or in later fragments) as `{{ fragment.name }}`.

```yaml
fragments:
  location: "{{ city }} at {{ time_of_day }}"
  full_scene: "{{ fragment.location }}, {{ weather }}"   # earlier fragment available here

prompt: |
  {{ character }}, {{ fragment.full_scene }}, masterpiece
```

Fragments are rendered in declaration order after all variables resolve. Fragments from connected Partials are merged in — the main YAML wins on name collisions.

---

### Partials

Wire one or more **Power Prompt Partial** nodes into a main node's include slots. Each partial contributes `variables:` and `fragments:` that merge into the main node's context — useful for reusable character, location, or style libraries.

```
include_1 → include_2 → … → main YAML   (main YAML always wins on name collision)
```

The `prompt:` key is not meaningful in a partial and is ignored.

---

### Node outputs

| Socket | Content |
|---|---|
| `prompt` | Normalized — newlines collapsed, whitespace trimmed, commas cleaned |
| `raw_prompt` | Unprocessed rendered output from the Jinja2 template |
